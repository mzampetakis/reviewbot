# ReviewBot ü§ñ
ReviewBot is a review chatbot that gathers customers' reviews after a completed purchase.

## Assumptions üôåüèª

We have made some assumption at this project in order to simplify and accelerate its development. These assumptions 
are: 
- The sentiment analysis and the text generator have been implemented as dummy but 3rd party integrations can be added
- For the chat implementation we have used a websocket communication channel
- Review chat support only one connection (client) at a time
- Database is pre-populated with some dummy data for testing purposes

## Requirements ‚úÖ
- Go v1.20
- make
- Docker
- Docker-compose

## Getting started üíª

ReviewBot offers an API and chatbot functionality for gathering user review after a purchase.

The application uses configuration through Environment variables. Here is a list with the details and the default
value for each one of them:

|------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `BASE_URL`       | Base URL of the API server.          | "http://localhost" |
| `HTTP_PORT`      | Port used byt the API server.        | "4444"             |
| `DB_HOST`        | Database host to use for connection. | "myreviewbotdb"    |
| `DB_USER`        | User of the database.                | "user"             |
| `DB_PASSWORD`    | User's password in the database      | "pass"             |

When all containers have started you will be able to access the API through:
```
http://localhost:4444
```
unless the default configuration has been updated. 

To review the logs of all containers execute:
```
make logs
```

In order to stop all running containers execute:
